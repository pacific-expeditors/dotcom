# Contributing

* Create a branch with a name of the feature you are creating. A good naming convention to follow is:
  username/my-feature
* Make your changes, test them, type check them, then commit and push them to GitHub. Add a brief description
  of what your branch is doing in the commit message.
* Wait for someone to review and approve your branch, then merge the branch into master.
* Keep your branches small to avoid merge conflicts and make sure to always create your branch from master.
